# Bookly__Home-CSS
This submodule contains the CSS specifically designed for the Home page of the Bookly project. It is organized to manage all the styles related to the Home page sections, ensuring a modular and maintainable structure for the Bookly project's front-end design.
Here is the properly formatted `README.md` content that can be directly copied into the file:

## Purpose

The `Bookly__home-CSS` submodule serves as the parent submodule for all Home-related CSS. It organizes the different sections of the Home page, providing clear separation and better scalability as the Bookly project evolves.

## File Structure

- **CSS/Home/**: This directory will contain all the Home page styles once the submodule is added to the project.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The styles are optimized for responsiveness, ensuring the Home page looks great on different devices.
- **Component-Based Styles**: Each section of the Home page has its own separate CSS, making it easier to manage and update individual parts of the page.
- **Seamless Integration**: The submodule integrates directly into the main Bookly project, allowing for easy updates and organization of Home page styles.

## Usage

1. To add the `Bookly__home-CSS` submodule to your main project, run the following command:
   ```bash
   git submodule add git@github.com:Je-Joestar24/Bookly__Home-CSS.git CSS/Home
   ```

2. After the submodule is added, it will be placed in the `CSS/Home/` directory of the main project.

3. To update or modify the Home page styles, navigate to the `CSS/Home/` directory within the submodule.

4. After making changes, commit and push the updates to the submodule before updating the main Bookly repository.

5. Make sure the submodule is initialized in the main project by running:
   ```bash
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```

## Notes

- The `Bookly__home-CSS` submodule is meant to keep all the Home page styles separate, making it easier to maintain and scale as the project grows.
- Future updates or additions to the Home page sections should follow the same structure within the `CSS/Home/` directory.
